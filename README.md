# CryptoTraits
*Developed by Mattia Ghilardi*

# Introduction
`CryptoTraits`is an ImageJ macro that allows a standardised, reproducible, and semi-automated "traditional" morphometric analysis of cryptobenthic fishes from side-view images. It is written in the ImageJ 1.x macro language, thus can be used in both ImageJ and Fiji. It was first being developed to aid trait measurement for a project on cryptobenthic reef fishes in Palau. The macro is under further development and will be included in a larger toolset for fish morphometric analysis.

# Installation
Download the file "CryptoTraits.ijm" and save it in the \macros\toolsets\ folder within the ImageJ or Fiji application folder.

Open ImageJ or FIJI and click on ">>" ("More tools" menu) in the toolbar, then select `CryptoTraits`.
