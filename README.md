# Description
`CryptoTraits`is an ImageJ macro that allows a standardised, reproducible, and semi-automated "traditional" morphometric analysis of cryptobenthic fishes from side-view images. It is written in the ImageJ 1.x macro language, thus can be used in both ImageJ and Fiji. It was first being developed to aid trait measurement for a project on cryptobenthic reef fishes in Palau. The macro is under further development and will be included in a larger toolset for fish morphometric analysis.

# Installation
To install the macro clone or download the entire repository, then copy the `CryptoTraits.ijm` file in the `ImageJ/macros/toolsets/` or `Fiji.app/macros/toolsets/` directory.

Open ImageJ/FIJI, click on the `More tools menu` (`>>`) in the toolbar and select `CryptoTraits`. The macro requires ImageJ 1.53e, thus if you have an older version you must first update it by clicking on **Help -> Update ImageJ...** After the update, restart ImageJ/Fiji and select `CryptoTraits` from the `More tools menu`.
